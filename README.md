# What Is This?

This is a project written for an interview.

# How To Run It?

Clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/3ub41r/kiddocare-pre-interview.git
```

If you don't want to mess with PHP installations. Run it with docker:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you already have PHP installed, you can just server the current directory with:

```
php -S localhost:80
```

Then go to `http://localhost/login.php`.
